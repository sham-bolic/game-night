# üéÆ Game Night - Party Games & Good Vibes

> *Made by friends, for friends. Built with vibe coding and lots of caffeine.*

A collection of party games and interactive experiences perfect for get-togethers, game nights, and when you want to have fun with your crew. No fancy frameworks, no over-engineering ‚Äì just pure fun coded with good vibes.

## üåü What's This All About?

Game Hub is our homegrown collection of party games that actually work when you need them to. Built during late-night coding sessions, weekend hackathons, and "hey, wouldn't it be cool if..." moments between friends.

**Philosophy**: Keep it simple, keep it fun, keep it working.

3. Start it up: `npm start`
4. Share the room code with your friends

## üõ† Tech Stack (The Vibe Coding Way)

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3 (because sometimes simple is better)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (reliable and straightforward)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io (for that instant party connection)
- **Styling**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, and whatever looked good at 2 AM
- **Database**: JSON files (we told you it was vibe coding)

*No build process. No compilation steps. Just code that works.*

## üé® Adding Your Own Games

Want to add a game? Here's the vibe:

1. Create a new folder in `/games/your-game-name`
2. Add your HTML, CSS, and JS files
3. Update the game registry in `games.json`
4. Test it with friends (most important step!)

Example game structure:
```
games/
  your-awesome-game/
    index.html
    style.css
    game.js
    config.json
```

Check out existing games for inspiration. Copy liberally, improve gradually.

## ü§ù Contributing (The Friend Way)

This is a friends project, so contributing should feel like hanging out:

- **Found a bug?** Tell us in Issues (or fix it if you're feeling it)
- **Have an idea?** Share it! Weird ideas welcome
- **Want to add a game?** Go for it! Weird games extra welcome
- **Code style?** If it works and isn't completely unreadable, it's good

### The Vibe Coding Guidelines
- Comments are for future you (and your confused friends)
- Function names should make sense at 2 AM

**Q: Why "vibe coding"?**

**Q: Is this production ready?**
A: It's "friends party ready" which is all we were aiming for.

**Q: Can I use this for my own parties?**
A: That's literally why we made it! Go wild.

**Q: The code looks weird in some places...**
A: Yeah, that's the vibe coding showing. If it's really bad, feel free to fix it.
